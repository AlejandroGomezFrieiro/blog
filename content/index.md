# 🍁 Hi, I'm Alejandro

I would like to consider myself a bit of a multi-passionate person. I am currently working as a Senior Quantum Engineer, building the Quantum Computers of the future.

This site is a [[digital garden]] for my writing.

# 📑 Blog

I sometimes write a [[blog_homepage|blog]] regaring personal thoughts and technology.
