A digital garden is a funny yet intutive mix between a notebook and a blog, where one takes care about the relationships between pages in a non-linear fashion.

While there is a long history of digital gardening, of which blogposts is only a small part of it, modern technology has made it easier than ever to do it and showcase it to the world.

I see the difference between a blogpost and a garden as follows:

A blogpost is a piece of writing where there is a clear beginning and an end. It is a linear path the author takes the reader on, more similar to a traditional book. Traditional storytelling takes place here.

In contrast, a digital garden is a collection of related texts, where one is free to go into any desired rabit hole. It can be seen as a **Personal Knowledge Management** system of sorts, where we find relations between different small topics.

The fact that it is an ever-evolving set of documents means that there will be failures as well, and from them one can learn.
